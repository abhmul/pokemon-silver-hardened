# pokemon-silver-hardened
My hack of pokemon silver to make it harder and more fun.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. Install [Visual Boy Advance](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vba/)
3. Start Visual Boy Advance and open "Pokemon Silver Hardened.gbc".

## Major Changes

- All pokemon encounter and trainer levelling has increased to make the game harder. Trainers will be slightly higher levels than you and wild pokemon will be at your level.
- Some 3rd and 4th generation pokemon were added and replace some 2nd and 1st generation pokemon. See [Changed PKMN.txt](https://github.com/abhmul/pokemon-silver-hardened/blob/master/Changed%20PKMN.txt)
- Available starters are Dratini, Larvitar, and Gible
- Gym Leaders run variants of [Smogon](https://www.smogon.com/) strategies
- Powerful trainers have genetically mutated their pokemon through artificial selection or other means
